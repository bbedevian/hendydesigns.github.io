VINYL PRINTING
Vinyl printing on garments is an excellent alternative to traditional printing. This type of printing utilizes a computer and vinyl machine to cut your design into vinyl, and is then heat pressed onto the garment.

Vinyl printing is best for rush jobs, same day printing, as well as clients wanting an alternative look to the traditional ink style methods of DTG and screen printing. New techniques involving gold and iridescent foils, as well as the highly reflective 3M material, fall under this category of printing
