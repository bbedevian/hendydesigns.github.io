<h2>VINYL PRINTING</h2>
Vinyl printing on garments is an excellent alternative to traditional printing. This type of printing utilizes a computer and vinyl machine to cut your design into vinyl, and is then heat pressed onto the garment.
<br /><br />
Vinyl printing is best for rush jobs, same day printing, as well as clients wanting an alternative look to the traditional ink style methods of DTG and screen printing. New techniques involving gold and iridescent foils, as well as the highly reflective 3M material, fall under this category of printing

<h2>SCREEN PRINTING</h2>
Screen printing is the most traditional and widely accepted as the best method for garment printing. Modern screen printing uses highly sophisticated automatic and manual presses to quickly print many shirts in a assembly-line process.
<br /><br />
A design is broken down into separate colors representing different screens, ink is applied, and physically pushed through the screen onto the garment. Screen printing is ideal for large production jobs.

<h2>DIRECT TO GARMENT PRINTING</h2>
Direct to Garment Printing also known as "DTG" is the most modern process for printing on garments. Here at BCCO we use a Kornit printer, which is revered as the best direct to garment printer on the market today.

This printing method is ideal for customers looking to print photographs, as well as other images that have many colors. DTG is an excellent alternative to screen printing, as you can print as few as a couple shirts without all of the costs!
