    <h2 id="terms-and-conditions">TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h2>
<p>The turnaround time on an order with BCCO NYC starts when you’ve paid in full and all required information has been received (i.e. all artwork, working /correct tags, all fonts required for editable tags, all shipping info, etc.). Delay in receipt of any of this information can, and likely will, result in production delays. Our current estimated turnaround time is between five and ten business days and does not including shipping time. Complex orders and add-ons may increase turnaround time. Delay in approval of mock ups, and additional finishing services can also result in production delays. The most up-to-date turnaround time will be listed on your quote and invoice.</p>

<p>If you have a deadline, it is necessary to inform us when placing your order. A rush fee may apply if there is not enough time to complete your order within our current margins. If you do not advise us of a due date until after your order has been paid for and production has been scheduled, we may not be able to accommodate your request, and additional charges may apply. Any circumstances out of BCCO NYC’s control (i.e. weather delays, shipping errors by the supplier, etc.) may require additional time and are not included in turn around estimates.</p>

<h2 id="faqs">FAQ’S</h2>
<p>Learn more about BCCO NYC:</p>

<h3 id="how-does-pricing-work">HOW DOES PRICING WORK?</h3>
<p>Pricing is specifically calculated for each individual client creation. Since many factors affect pricing including desired turnaround time, number of pieces needed, method of printing, and difficulty of artwork, all orders are quoted on a case by case basis.</p>

<h3 id="do-i-need-to-make-an-appointment">DO I NEED TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT?</h3>
<p>An appointment is strongly encouraged as each of our Account Representatives work with multiple clients to bring their designs to life, and we’d hate to make you wait. Artwork files are of the utmost importance in regards to your design creation, so please send these files to us prior to your meeting, if possible. To make an appointment please call 347-836-9116, send us an email with attached artwork to info@bcconyc.com, or make an appointment online at <a href="https://www.Picktime.com/BCCONYC">www.Picktime.com/BCCONYC</a> Walk-ins will be seen within our schedule, and therefore may be required to wait.</p>

<h3 id="can-you-shipdeliver-my-order">CAN YOU SHIP/DELIVER MY ORDER?</h3>
<p>Yes, we ship domestically within the United States, as well as providing messenger service within New York City. Shipping and delivery charges will added to your invoice.</p>

<h3 id="what-wholesale-brands-can-i-purchase-shirts-from-through-bcco-nyc">WHAT WHOLESALE BRANDS CAN I PURCHASE SHIRTS FROM THROUGH BCCO NYC?</h3>
<p>Please refer to our “Wholesale Partnerships” page which details the clothing manufactures we have accounts with. If you do not see a company present that you would like to use, please inquire about them, and we will do our best to accommodate you.</p>

<h3 id="can-i-supply-my-own-shirts">CAN I SUPPLY MY OWN SHIRTS?</h3>
<p>Yes, although we do encourage that you order your garments through one of our trusted partners. If you supply your own shirts, BCCO is not responsible for any damages or disfigurations that might occur during the printing process.</p>

<h3 id="returns-refunds--exchanges">RETURNS, REFUNDS, &amp; EXCHANGES</h3>
<p>There are NO returns, refunds, or exchanges on any custom order placed.</p>

<h3 id="mistakes">MISTAKES</h3>
<p>We take great care to ensure that everything we create is of the highest quality. All of our clients are valued clients, and we want to exceed your expectations. In the event that you do find something wrong, let us know. We allow a 48-hour window, starting from the time you receive your order, to be informed of errors and have them corrected. We are not responsible for items that have already been sold or distributed.</p>

<h3 id="cancellation-policy">CANCELLATION POLICY</h3>
<p>There is a 50% cancellation fee for an order placed after any portion of an invoice has been paid. There is an additional restocking fee and you will be responsible for any return shipping fees for merchandise not used, as well as any cost of wasted material.</p>

<h3 id="copyright">COPYRIGHT</h3>
<p>If you wish to produce items on behalf of large companies holding copyrights such as the New York Yankees, Mets, Giants, Coca-Cola, etc, you will need to provide an official certificate from the organization stating that you have permission to reproduce their likeness. We do not illegally produce (bootleg) garments of any sort.
We do not claim ownership of any photographs used on this site, unless otherwise noted by BCCO NYC. Photographs on this site are strictly for promotional use only, and are not intended to be infringing upon the rights of their owners. If your photograph is being used and you would like us to remove it, please contact info@bcconyc.com for a prompt removal.</p>

<h3 id="social-media-sharing">SOCIAL MEDIA SHARING</h3>
<p>We love to stay connected with our clients through various social media outlets like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. This often means posting pictures of the awesome designs you have created with us. We like to show off our hard work! We reserve the right to post on any social media outlet, blog, or website, including our own, and replicate any photos of our prints . If you’d prefer to keep your design under wraps, just let us know beforehand, and we will happily honor your wishes.</p>

<h3 id="image-placement">IMAGE PLACEMENT</h3>
<p>Slight disparities can be expected in regards to image placement. We cannot guarantee that each image will be printed in the exact same distance from either seam or collar on every individual garment. Each item is made by hand and variations tend to be indistinguishable.</p>

<h3 id="color-matchings">COLOR MATCHINGS</h3>
<p>Colors look different on every computer screen which is why we use the Pantone Solid Coated System to match our colors. If you have access to them, send us the Pantone Solid Coated numbers you would like to use for your design. This allows us to match your colors as accurately as possible. When digitally printing items, colors may vary. We do our best to keep the color’s integrity as much as possible.
We do not guarantee any color matching for DTG prints.</p>
