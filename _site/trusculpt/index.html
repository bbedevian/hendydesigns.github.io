<h2 id="what-is-trusculpt-flex">What is truSculpt® flex?</h2>

<p>truSculpt flex is a personalized muscle sculpting treatment that adjusts to your fitness level, shape, and goals to strengthen, firm, and tone your muscles. The unique Multi-Directional Stimulation (MDS) technology delivers three treatment options by replicating intensified crunch, squat and twisting actions. It’s the edge you need to look and feel your best.</p>
